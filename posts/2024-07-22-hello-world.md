# Hello World

After trying complex themes on GitHub Pages, I found myself consumed by setup rather than writing. Inspired by [bearblog's](https://bearblog.dev/) simplicity, I created a minimalist blog focused purely on contentâ€”no frills, just writing and publishing.

To achieve this, I developed a straightforward static site generator using Python. It takes Markdown files and converts them into simple HTML pages with minimal styling. The result is a clean, fast-loading blog that puts the spotlight on the content.

This approach eliminates the distractions of complex themes, plugins, and endless customization options. Now, I can focus on what really matters: sharing my thoughts and ideas through writing.

The simplicity extends to the publishing process as well. With Git and GitHub Pages, I can easily update my blog by pushing new Markdown files to the repository. This streamlined workflow encourages me to write more frequently and spend less time on technical setup.

By embracing minimalism in both design and process, I've rediscovered the joy of blogging. It's a return to the essence of what blogging should be: a platform for ideas, not a showcase of web design skills.
