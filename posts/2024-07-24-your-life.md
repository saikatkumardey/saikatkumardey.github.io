## Your Life Visualized

I released a simple app called ["Your Life Visualized"](https://saikatkumardey.com/your-life) that visualizes your life in months. It's a simple concept but it's a powerful way to see how much time you have left. I hope you find it useful.

It was inspired from [Wait But Why's](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html) post on visualizing life in weeks. I wanted to create a similar visualization but with months instead of weeks.

You can tap on any month to add a note or a milestone.

There is no storage right now. I plan to add browser's local storage to save notes and milestones next.

It doesn't work well on mobile yet. I plan to make it responsive soon.
