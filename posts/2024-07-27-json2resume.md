# json2resume

I built a simple tool called [json2resume](https://saikatkumardey.com/json2resume) that converts JSON to a resume.

The input is a standard JSON object based on the [jsonresume.org](https://jsonresume.org/schema) schema. The output is a resume in HTML format. 

You could customize the look and feel of the resume. When you're happy with the result, you can download the resume as a PDF.

I am working on a complementary tool called resume2json that converts a resume in PDF format to a standard JSON as per the schema. I can then take the JSON and use it in json2resume to convert it back to a resume.

Why? I wanted to standardize my resume so it is easier to maintain and update. Usually, I use [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com) to create my resume. But I wanted to build something simpler and easy to use.

I am still tinkering with these ideas. Maybe we could build a resume builder out of this. Let's see where this goes.
