Have you ever felt like it's too late to pursue your dreams? Perhaps you feel like you're too old, or you've missed your chance. If so, it's time to reconsider. The story of Van Gogh is a perfect example of how it's never too late to start something and become world-class at it.

Van Gogh is one of the most famous and celebrated artists in history, known for his beautiful and unique paintings. But did you know that he didn't start painting seriously until he was 27 years old? That's right, it was well into his adult life before Van Gogh began pursuing his passion for art.

Despite starting later in life, Van Gogh was incredibly productive. Over the course of just 10 years, he created over 2,000 artworks. And most of those were created in the last two years of his life. In just a short amount of time, Van Gogh was able to achieve incredible success and make a lasting impact on the world of art.

This is proof that it's never too late to start something and become world-class at it. If Van Gogh could do it, so can you. So don't let age or any other perceived limitations hold you back. It's never too late to pursue your dreams and make them a reality. Take inspiration from Van Gogh and start working towards your goals today. You never know what you might be capable of achieving.
