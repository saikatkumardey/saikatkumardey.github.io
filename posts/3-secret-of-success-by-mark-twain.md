In today's world, it can often feel like there are so many things to do and so little time to do them. It can be overwhelming to think about all the tasks and responsibilities that we have, and it can be difficult to know where to even begin. But as the famous author Marc Twain once said,

> The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks, and starting on the first one.

In other words, the key to success is simply to take that first step. It can be intimidating to tackle a large and complex task, but by breaking it down into smaller, manageable pieces, it becomes much more manageable. And once you've taken that first step, the rest will start to fall into place.

This quote is a great reminder that we don't have to be perfect from the start. It's okay to start small and work our way up â€“ in fact, it's the best way to make progress. So the next time you're feeling overwhelmed by a big project or task, remember Marc Twain's words and just start on the first step. You'll be amazed at how much you can accomplish when you simply get started.
