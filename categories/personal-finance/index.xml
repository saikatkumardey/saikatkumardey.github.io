&lt;p>When the market is down, it&amp;rsquo;s giving you an opportunity to buy equity at a discount.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do not pick individual stocks. You&amp;rsquo;re not a trader. Invest into index funds &amp;amp; ETFs instead. Read up on &lt;a href="https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Getting_started">Bogleheads Philosophy&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Automate your investments. SIPs are the way to go. Time in the market is more important than timing the market.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The real fruit of your investments will be seen years later. Let compound interest do her thing silently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You should focus on being the best at what you do. Worrying about the market is a waste of your time which could be utilised in honing your craft.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When the market is up, keep buying. When the market is down, buy more.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
