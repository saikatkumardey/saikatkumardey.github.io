It&amp;rsquo;s so much fun to learn from people from all over the world who are kind enough to unconditionally share their experiences.
IMO, the best resources are buried deep inside reddit comments that could be discovered if you&amp;rsquo;re hungry enough!
Here are the best content I discovered so far:
r/kaidomac: subreddit for aggregating knowledge from user u/kaidomac, managed by the author himself. Some of his best posts: - The WPP Approach to planning out your day - Life planning - Macros tutorial r/theXeffect: People here are on a 50-day journey to create/break one or more habits by simply making a 7x7 grid on a card and crossing off each day with a fat-ass felt marker, because your willpower is like a muscle, and it gets stronger and stronger as you exercise it.</description></item></channel></rss>
