&lt;p>What happens when those companies go out of business? All of your data would be lost unless you&amp;rsquo;ve kept a backup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://sive.rs/plaintext">Derek Sivers&lt;/a> recommends keeping your content on text files. Text files are cross-platform &amp;amp; easy to manage. You could easily convert them to the format of your choice. You do not need the internet to access your files. Sure, online platforms might provide a better UI. However, you don&amp;rsquo;t really need the distraction while putting down your raw thoughts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have many ideas jotted down across multiple platforms, apps and yes, text files on my devices. From now on, I will use this website as my own digital garden to keep it all. I will start gathering all my posts from the past scattered across different platforms and share them in this space.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Never Too Late</title><link>https://saikatkumardey.com/daily/4-never-too-late/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 May 2022 22:40:51 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://saikatkumardey.com/daily/4-never-too-late/</guid><description>&lt;p>Van Gogh started painting seriously at 27.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He created over 2000 artworks over a decade, most of which were created in the last 2 years of his life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s never too late to start anything and become world class at it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Van Gogh did it. You could do it too.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Keep Investing</title><link>https://saikatkumardey.com/daily/3-keep-investing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 May 2022 21:03:26 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://saikatkumardey.com/daily/3-keep-investing/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you have money to spare, invest it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When the market is down, it&amp;rsquo;s giving you an opportunity to buy equity at a discount.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do not pick individual stocks. You&amp;rsquo;re not a trader. Invest into index funds &amp;amp; ETFs instead. Read up on &lt;a href="https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Getting_started">Bogleheads Philosophy&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Automate your investments. SIPs are the way to go. Time in the market is more important than timing the market.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The real fruit of your investments will be seen years later. Let compound interest do her thing silently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You should focus on being the best at what you do. Worrying about the market is a waste of your time which could be utilised in honing your craft.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When the market is up, keep buying. When the market is down, buy more.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hosting on Github Pages</title><link>https://saikatkumardey.com/daily/2-hosting-on-github-pages/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 May 2022 00:44:31 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://saikatkumardey.com/daily/2-hosting-on-github-pages/</guid><description>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Make sure you have a &lt;a href="https://github.com/saikatkumardey/saikatkumardey.github.io/blob/main/CNAME">CNAME&lt;/a> file with your custom website in it. Make sure that you have it in your &amp;ldquo;gh-pages&amp;rdquo; branch.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Ensure that you have configured the CNAME in your DNS provider&amp;rsquo;s console. I am using &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare&lt;/a>. So, I have configured 2 records&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>CNAME to redirect &amp;ldquo;saikatkumardey.com&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;saikatkumardey.github.io&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>CNAME to redirect &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.saikatkumardey.com">www.saikatkumardey.com&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;saikatkumardey.github.io&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Make sure that you set the Source of your Github Pages site to be built from the gh-pages branch. Go to Settings &amp;gt; Pages &amp;gt; Source. Check if it&amp;rsquo;s set to gh-pages. This caused me a lot of pain. It&amp;rsquo;s set to &amp;ldquo;main&amp;rdquo; by default.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

&lt;p>You get to be with your family.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You get to save a lot on rent, commute and overall high cost of living.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You could do &lt;a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/">deep work&lt;/a>. Tuning out all the notifications is easy. You could focus on getting things done.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h3 id="remote-work-set-up-is-bad">Remote work set-up is bad.&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You don&amp;rsquo;t get to meet your team-mates regularly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Building trust takes a longer time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;re not fully engaged with the company.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Brainstorming with your colleagues is not seamless. In office, you could just walk up to their desk and ask for their suggestion.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Hybrid work set-up is the way. We need the flexibility to do &amp;ldquo;deep work&amp;rdquo; from home most of the times as well as to meet our team every couple of months.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
