        <h2>Hello World</h2>
        <p>After trying complex themes on GitHub Pages, I found myself consumed by setup rather than writing. Inspired by <a href="https://bearblog.dev/">bearblog's</a> simplicity, I created a minimalist blog focused purely on content—no frills, just writing and publishing.</p>
<p>To achieve this, I developed a straightforward static site generator using Python. It takes Markdown files and converts them into simple HTML pages with minimal styling. The result is a clean, fast-loading blog that puts the spotlight on the content.</p>
<p>This approach eliminates the distractions of complex themes, plugins, and endless customization options. Now, I can focus on what really matters: sharing my thoughts and ideas through writing.</p>
<p>The simplicity extends to the publishing process as well. With Git and GitHub Pages, I can easily update my blog by pushing new Markdown files to the repository. This streamlined workflow encourages me to write more frequently and spend less time on technical setup.</p>
<p>By embracing minimalism in both design and process, I've rediscovered the joy of blogging. It's a return to the essence of what blogging should be: a platform for ideas, not a showcase of web design skills.</p>
